- **Docker container** security hardening
- **Regular dependency** updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets management** through environment variables

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private reporting** of vulnerabilities
2. **Coordinated disclosure** timeline
3. **Public disclosure** only after fixes are available
4. **Credit** to security researchers (with permission)

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to Luna Services, please follow these security guidelines:

#### Code Review
- All code changes require security review
- Use static analysis tools (ESLint, Bandit)
- Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

#### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` regularly
- Pin dependency versions in production

#### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly

#### Database Access
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Audit database permissions regularly

### Security Testing

We encourage security testing but ask that you:

1. **Do not access** data that doesn't belong to you
2. **Do not perform** destructive testing
3. **Do not spam** our services or APIs
4. **Respect** rate limits and system resources
5. **Test only** against your own accounts/data

### Bug Bounty Program

Currently, Luna Services does not offer a bug bounty program. However, we recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

- **Hall of Fame** listing on our website
- **Public recognition** in release notes
- **Direct communication** with the development team

### Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@luna-services.dev
- **Lead Developer**: drago@luna-services.dev
- **Emergency Contact**: For critical vulnerabilities affecting production

### Legal

This security policy is subject to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Security research conducted in accordance with this policy will not result in legal action against the researcher.

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Supabase Auth**: Secure user authentication with JWT tokens
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Role-based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions system
- **API Key Management**: Secure API key generation and validation

### Data Protection

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Review

- All code changes require review by at least one maintainer
- Security-sensitive changes require review by a security-aware maintainer
- Automated security scanning is performed on all pull requests

### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use `npm audit` and `pip-audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Prefer well-maintained packages with good security track records

### Environment Variables

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use `.env.example` for configuration templates
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Database Security

- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Validate all inputs
- Use database migrations for schema changes

## Vulnerability Disclosure Examples

### Example 1: Authentication Bypass

```
Subject: Authentication Bypass in User Management

Description:
I found a vulnerability in the user management system that allows an 
attacker to bypass authentication checks by manipulating JWT tokens.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a user account
2. Intercept the JWT token
3. Modify the role claim to "admin"
4. Use the modified token to access admin endpoints

Impact:
An attacker could gain administrative access to the system.
```

### Example 2: SQL Injection

```
Subject: SQL Injection in Project Search

Description:
The project search functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection through
the search parameter.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to /api/projects/search
2. Submit the following payload: `'; DROP TABLE projects; --`
3. Observe database error

Impact:
An attacker could read, modify, or delete database contents.
```
